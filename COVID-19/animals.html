     <p>What You Need to Know  <br>
        <br> • The risk of animals spreading SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, to people is low. <br>
        <br> • The virus can spread from people to animals during close contact. <br>
        <br> • More studies and surveillance are needed to understand how SARS-CoV-2 is spread between people
         and animals. <br>
        <br> • People with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 should avoid contact with animals, including pets, 
        livestock, and wildlife. <br>
        <br> Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses. Some coronaviruses cause cold-like illnesses in people,
         while others cause illness in certain types of animals, such as cattle, camels, and bats. Some 
         coronaviruses, such as canine and feline coronaviruses, infect only animals and do not infect people.</p>

      <p>At this time, there is no evidence that animals play a significant role in spreading SARS-CoV-2, the 
        virus that causes COVID-19, to people. However, there have been reports of infected animals 
        (mink, hamsters, and deer) spreading the virus to people during close contact, but this is rare. 
        More studies and surveillance are needed to understand how SARS-CoV-2 is spread between people and 
        animals. <br>

       <br>  Some coronaviruses that infect animals can be spread to people and then spread between people, but this 
        is rare. This is what happened with SARS-CoV-2, which likely originated in bats.</p>

      <p>Reports of animals infected with SARS-CoV-2 have been documented around the world. Most of these
         animals became infected after contact with people with COVID-19, including owners, caretakers, or 
         others who were in close contact. We don't yet know all of the animals that can get infected. Animals 
         reported infected worldwide include: <br>

        <br> • Companion animals, including pet cats, dogs, hamsters, and ferrets. <br>
        <br> • Animals in zoos and sanctuaries, including several types of big cats (e.g., lions, tigers, 
        snow leopards), otters, non-human primates, a binturong, a coatimundi, a fishing cat, hyenas, 
        hippopotamuses, and manatees. <br>
        <br> • Mink on mink farms. <br>
        <br> • Wildlife, including white-tailed deer, mule deer, a black-tailed marmoset, a giant anteater, and
         wild mink near mink farms.</p>

       <h1>Mink and SARS-CoV-2</h1>
   </div>
   <div class="description">
       <p>SARS-CoV-2 has been reported in mink on farms in multiple countries.

        In the United States, respiratory disease and increases in mink deaths have been seen on most affected 
        mink farms. However, some infected mink might also appear healthy. Infected workers likely introduced 
        SARS-CoV-2 to mink on the farms, and the virus then began to spread among the mink. Once the virus is 
        introduced on a farm, spread can occur between mink, as well as from mink to other animals on the farm 
        (dogs, cats). One wild and a small number of escaped mink trapped near affected farms in Utah and Oregon 
        were found to be infected with SARS-CoV-2. <br>
        
       
        <br> Although there is no evidence that mink are playing a significant role in the spread of SARS-CoV-2 to
         people, there is a possibility of mink spreading SARS-CoV-2 to people and other animals on mink farms. 
         Mink-to-human spread of SARS-CoV-2 has been reported in the Netherlands, Denmark, and Poland, and recent 
         data suggest it might have occurred in the United States. <br>
        
       <br>  • Investigations found that mink from a Michigan farm and a small number of people were infected with 
        SARS-CoV-2 that contained unique mink-related mutations (changes in the virus's genetic material). This 
        suggests mink-to-human spread might have occurred. <br>

        <br> • Finding these mutations in mink on the Michigan farm is not unexpected because they have been seen
         before in mink from farms in the Netherlands and Denmark, and also in people linked to mink farms 
         worldwide. <br>

        <br> • To confirm the spread of SARS-CoV-2 from mink to people, public health officials would need more 
        information on the epidemiology and genetics of the virus in mink, mink farm workers, and the 
        communities around mink farms. <br>

        <br> • These results highlight the importance of routinely studying the genetic material of SARS-CoV-2 in 
        susceptible animal populations like mink, as well as in people.</p>

        <h1>Research on animals and COVID-19</h1>
   </div>        
   <div class="description">
       <p>Many studies have been done to learn more about how this virus can affect different animals. These 
        findings were based on a small number of animals, and do not show whether animals can spread infection to
         people. <br>

       <br> Recent experimental research shows that many mammals, including cats, dogs, bank voles, ferrets, fruit 
        bats, hamsters, mink, pigs, rabbits, racoon dogs, tree shrews, red foxes, and white-tailed deer can be 
        infected with the virus. Cats, ferrets, fruit bats, hamsters, racoon dogs, and white-tailed deer can also
         spread the infection to other animals of the same species in laboratory settings. <br>
        
       <br> A number of studies have investigated non-human primates as models for human infection. Rhesus macaques, 
        cynomolgus macaques, baboons, grivets, and common marmosets can become infected with SARS-CoV-2 and become
         sick in a laboratory setting. There is some evidence suggesting that laboratory mice, which could not 
         be infected with original strains of SARS-CoV-2, can be infected with new virus variants. <br>
        
        <br> Chickens and ducks do not seem to become infected or spread the infection based on results from 
        studies.</p>
