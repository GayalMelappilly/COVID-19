</header>

<section class="section">
   <div class="description">
     <p>As countries are taking stronger measures to contain the spread of COVID-19, self-quarantine
         and the temporary closing of businesses may affect normal food-related practices. Healthy 
         individuals, as well as those showing acute respiratory disease symptoms, are being requested 
         to stay at home. In some countries, restaurants and take-away offers are being limited and some
          fresh items are becoming less available. <br>

       <br> Good nutrition is crucial for health, particularly in times when the immune system might need to
         fight back. Limited access to fresh foods may compromise opportunities to continue eating a 
         healthy and varied diet. It can also potentially lead to an increased consumption of highly 
         processed foods, which tend to be high in fats, sugars and salt. Nonetheless, even with few 
         and limited ingredients, one can continue eating a diet that supports good health. <br>
        
      <br>  For optimal health, it is also important to remain physically active. To support healthy 
        individuals in staying physically active while at home, WHO/Europe has developed specific
         guidance for periods of quarantine, including tips and examples of home-based exercises. <br></p>
   </div>
   <div class="sub-heading">
      <h1>Make a plan - take only what you need </h1>
   </div>
   <div class="description">
      <p>Multiple cases of over-purchasing have been observed throughout the WHO European Region. 
        Panic buying behaviour may have negative consequences, such as an increase in food prices,
         overconsumption of food and an unequal distribution of products. It is therefore important to 
         consider your own needs, as well as those of others. Assess what you already have at home and
          plan your intake. You might feel the need to purchase large amounts of foods, but make sure to
           consider and utilize what is already in your pantry, as well as foods with shorter shelf life.
            This way you can avoid food waste and allow others to access the food they need.</p>
   </div>
   <div class="sub-heading">
      <h1>Be strategic about the use of ingredients - <br>prioritize fresh products</h1>
   </div>
   <div class="description">
      <p>Use fresh ingredients and those that have a shorter shelf life first. If fresh products, 
        especially fruits, vegetables and reduced-fat dairy products continue to be available,
         prioritize these over non-perishables. Frozen fruits and vegetables can also conveniently 
         be used over longer periods of time and often have a similar nutrient profile to fresh foods. 
         To avoid food waste, you may consider freezing any leftovers for another meal.</p>
   </div>
   <div class="sub-heading">
       <h1>Prepare home-cooked meals </h1>
   </div>
   <div class="description">
       <p>During regular daily life, many individuals often do not have the time to prepare home-cooked meals.
         Spending longer periods of time at home may now offer the possibility to make those recipes
          you previously did not have time to make. Many healthy and delicious recipes can be found online. 
          Take advantage of the wealth of freely available information, and experiment with the ingredients 
          you can access, but remember to keep in mind the principles for healthy eating offered in this
           guidance. Some examples of healthy recipes with accessible ingredients may also be found below.</p>
   </div>        

   <div class="sub-heading">
        <h1>Take advantage of food delivery options </h1>
   </div>        
   <div class="description">
       <p>Although home-cooked meals should be prioritized, some cities and countries have rathe
        r advanced delivery systems for ingredients and ready meals, and many businesses are now 
        starting to offer this service. Some solutions include “contact-less” options, where no human 
        interaction is required, thus supporting self-quarantine and isolation measures. These should 
        be prioritized, particularly from reliable businesses following strict food hygiene requirements. 
        For food delivery and transportation, it is important to keep food at safe temperatures 
        (below 5 °C or above 60 °C). Keeping in mind that these services might be overwhelmed, you might 
        want to consider exploring what is available in your area.

        <h1>Be aware of portion sizes </h1>
   </div>
   <div class="description">
        <p>It can be difficult to get portion sizes right, especially when cooking from scratch. Being 
            at home for extended periods, especially without company or with limited activities can also
             lead to overeating. Seek guidance through your national food-based dietary guidelines on what 
             constitutes healthy portions for adults and be mindful that young children will need smaller
              portions.</p>
   </div>
   <div class="sub-heading">
        <h1>Follow safe food handling practices </h1>
   </div>
   <div class="description">
        <p>Food safety is a prerequisite for food security and a healthy diet. Only safe food is healthy
             food. When preparing food for yourself and others, it is important to follow good food 
             hygiene practices to avoid food contamination and foodborne diseases. The key principles 
             of good food hygiene include: <br>

            <br> • Keep your hands, kitchen and utensils clean <br>
             • Separate raw and cooked food, especially raw meat and fresh produce <br>
             • Cook your food thoroughly <br>
             • Keep your food at safe temperatures, either below 5 °C or above 60 °C; and <br>
             • Use safe water and raw material. <br>

          <br>  By following these five key recommendations for safer food, you can prevent many common 
            foodborne diseases. <br>

   <div class="sub-heading">
       <h1>Limit your salt intake </h1>
   </div>
   <div class="description">
       <p>The availability of fresh foods may decrease and it may therefore become necessary to rely more
         on canned, frozen or processed foods. Many of these foods contain high levels of salt. WHO
          recommends consuming less than 5 g of salt per day. In order to achieve this, prioritize foods
           with reduced or no added salt. You may also consider rinsing canned foods such as vegetables 
           and beans, to remove some of the excess sodium. Be aware that pickled foods often contain high 
           levels of sodium too. In many countries, 50-75% of the salt intake comes from the foods we
            eat, rather than what we add ourselves. Given that you might be consuming enough salt already,
             avoid adding extra salt when cooking and to your meals at the table. Experiment with fresh or
              dried herbs and spices for added flavour instead. </p>
   </div>
   <div class="sub-heading"><h1>Limit your sugar intake</h1></div>
   <div class="description">
       <p>WHO recommends that ideally less than 5% of total energy intake for adults should come from
         free sugars (about 6 teaspoons). If you crave something sweet, fresh fruit should always be the
          priority. Frozen fruits, canned fruits in juice rather than syrup, and dried fruits with no 
          added sugar are also good options. When other dessert options are chosen, ensure that they are 
          low in sugar and consume small portions. Watch out for low fat options, as these are often high
           in added sugars. Limit the amount of sugar or honey added to foods and avoid sweetening your 
           beverages.</p>
   </div>
   <div class="sub-heading">
    <h1>Limit your fat intake  </h1>
 </div>
 <div class="description">
    <p>WHO recommends limiting total fat intake to less than 30% of total energy intake, of which no more
         than 10% should come from saturated fat. To achieve this, opt for cooking methods that require
          less or no fat, such as steaming, grilling or sautéing instead of frying foods. If needed, use
           small amounts of unsaturated oils like rapeseed, olive or sunflower oil to cook foods. Prefer 
           foods that contain healthy sources of unsaturated fats, such as fish and nuts. To limit saturated
            fats, trim excess fat from meat and poultry and choose skinless options. Reduce foods such as 
            red and fatty meats, butter and full-fat dairy products, palm oil, coconut oil, solid shortening
             and lard. <br>

       <br> Avoid trans fats as much as possible. Read nutrition labels to ensure that partially
        hydrogenated oils are not listed in the ingredients. If food labels are not available, avoid 
        foods which commonly contain trans fats such as processed and fried foods, like doughnuts and 
        baked goods - including biscuits, pie crusts, frozen pizzas, cookies, crackers and margarines that
         include partially hydrogenated fat. If in doubt, minimally processed foods and ingredients are better
          choices. <br></p>
 </div>
 <div class="sub-heading">
    <h1>Consume enough fibre </h1>
 </div>
 <div class="description">
    <p>Fibre contributes to a healthy digestive system and offers a prolonged feeling of fullness, which 
        helps prevent overeating. To ensure an adequate fibre intake, aim to include vegetables, fruit, 
        pulses and wholegrain foods in all meals. Wholegrains foods include oats, brown pasta and rice, 
        quinoa and whole-wheat bread and wraps, rather than refined grain foods such as white pasta and rice, 
        and white bread. <br></p>
 </div>
 <div class="sub-heading">
     <h1>Stay hydrated </h1>
 </div>
 <div class="description">
     <p>Good hydration is crucial for optimal health. Whenever available and safe for consumption, 
        tap water is the healthiest and cheapest drink. It is also the most sustainable, as it produces 
        no waste, compared to bottled water. Drinking water instead of sugar-sweetened beverages is a 
        simple way to limit your intake of sugar and excess calories. To enhance its taste, fresh or frozen 
        fruits like berries or slices of citrus fruits may be added, as well as cucumber or herbs such as 
        mint, lavender or rosemary. <br>

      <br>  Avoid drinking large amounts of strong coffee, strong tea, and especially caffeinated soft drinks
       and energy drinks. These may lead to dehydration and can negatively impact your sleeping patterns. <br></p>
 </div>        

 <div class="sub-heading">
      <h1>Avoid alcohol or at least reduce your alcohol <br> consumption </h1>
 </div>        
 <div class="description">
     <p>Alcohol is not only a mind-altering and dependence-producing substance, harmful at any level 
        consumed, but it also weakens the immune system. Thus, alcohol use and especially heavy use
         undermines your body's ability to cope with infectious disease, including COVID-19. <br>

       <br> It is recommended that alcohol in general be avoided, but especially when in self-quarantine. As
         a psychoactive substance, alcohol also affects your mental state and decision-making and makes
          you more vulnerable to risks, such as falls, injuries, or violence when under quarantine with 
          someone else. Alcohol consumption is also known to increase symptoms of depression, anxiety,
           fear and panic - symptoms that can intensify during isolation and self-quarantine. Consuming 
           alcohol is not a good coping mechanism, neither in the short nor long term, although you might
            think that it will help you deal with stress. <br>
        
        <br> Alcohol also makes certain medications less effective, while increasing the potency and toxicity 
        of others. Do not consume alcohol in combination with pain medication, as alcohol will interfere 
        with your liver functions and might cause serious problems, including liver failure. <br>
        
       <br> Under no circumstances should you consume any type of alcoholic products as a preventive or treatment 
        measure against COVID-19. <br>
        
        <br> Alcohol is not a necessary part of your diet and not part of a healthy lifestyle and should therefore
         not be on your shopping list. <br></p>
 </div>
 <div class="sub-heading">
      <h1>Enjoy family meals</h1>
 </div>
 <div class="description">
      <p>The social distancing associated with the COVID-19 outbreak has meant that many families are 
        spending more time at home, which provides new opportunities to share meals together. Family meals 
        are an important opportunity for parents to be role models for healthy eating, and for strengthening 
        family relationships. <br>

       <br> Increased time at home during this period may also present new opportunities to involve children
         in cooking healthy foods, which can help them acquire important life skills that they can carry
          into adulthood. Letting children choose what vegetables to include in your meal may encourage 
          them to eat them at the table. When involving children in cooking, it is important to keep meals
           simple and to teach children about proper food safety (including hand washing, cleaning surfaces
            and avoiding consumption of certain raw ingredients). <br></p>
