      yourself for infection before you get together and wearing a mask when indoors with them.</p> <br>

        respirator when the COVID-19 Community Level is medium.   <br>
        • Wear a mask or respirator that provides them with greater protection when the COVID-19 Community Level

        <h1>Children</h1>
   </div>        
   <div class="description">
       <p>Children ages 2 years and older can wear masks or respirators to protect themselves and others from 
        COVID-19. <br>

       <br> Choose a well-fitting and comfortable mask or respirator that your child can wear properly. A poorly 
        fitting or uncomfortable mask or respirator might be worn incorrectly or removed often, and that would 
        reduce its intended benefits. <br>
        
       <br>• Choose a size that fits over the child's nose and under the chin but does not impair vision. <br>

        • Follow the user instructions for the mask or respirator. These instructions may show how to make sure 
        the product fits properly. <br>

        • Some types of masks and respirators may feel different if your child is used to wearing cloth or 
        disposable procedure masks. <br>

       <br> Parents and caregivers may have questions about NIOSH-approved respirators (such as N95s), and 
        international respirators (such as KN95s and KF94s) for children. Although respirators may be 
        available in smaller sizes, they are typically designed to be used by adults in workplaces, and 
        therefore may not have been tested for broad use in children. <br></p>
   </div>
   <div class="sub-heading">
        <h1>Safety precautions</h1>
   </div>
   <div class="description">
        <p> • If your child has a medical condition, such as a heart or lung problem, ask their healthcare provider
             before they use methods to improve mask fit or use an ASTM F3502 mask or a respirator. <br>

            <br> • If your child has a hard time breathing, gets dizzy, or has other symptoms while you are trying to 
            get the mask to fit better or when using an ASTM F3502 mask or a respirator, choose a cloth or 
            disposable mask. They should continue to protect themselves and others. Consult your healthcare
             provider if these symptoms do not resolve. <br></p>
   </div>
   <div class="sub-heading">
        <h1>People with disabilities</h1>
   </div>
   <div class="description">
        <p>Certain groups of people may find it difficult to wear a mask, including people of any age
             with certain disabilities. <br>

           <br> Challenges may be caused by being sensitive to materials on the face, difficulty understanding 
            the importance of mask wearing for protection, or having difficulty controlling behavior to
             keep the mask in place. <br>
            
           <br> People with certain disabilities or their caregivers can assess whether they need to wear a 
            mask. They should do this by considering the person's ability to: <br>
            
          <br>• Wear a mask correctly (proper mask size and fit) <br>
          • Avoid frequent touching of the mask and face <br>
          • Limit sucking, drooling, or having excess saliva on the mask <br>
          • Remove the mask without assistance <br></p>
   </div>
   <div class="sub-heading">
       <h1>People who are deaf or hard of hearing</h1>
   </div>
   <div class="description">
       <p>These individuals may consider: <br>

       <br>• Wearing a clear mask or a cloth mask with a clear panel <br>

       • If a clear mask is not available, using written communication, closed captioning, or decreasing 
        background noise to make communication possible while wearing a mask that blocks lips <br></p>

    <h1>How to take off your mask</h1>
 </div>
 <div class="description">
    <p>1. For reusable cloth masks <br>
       <br> • If your cloth mask is wet or dirty, put it in a sealed plastic bag until you can wash it. This
         will keep it from getting moldy. <br>
         • If your cloth mask is dry and clean, you can store it in a breathable bag
         (like a paper or mesh fabric bag) to keep it clean between uses in the same day. <br>
         • Cloth masks should be washed at least once a day or as soon as they become wet or dirty. You can
         either wash and dry your masks by hand or use a washer and dryer. <br>
      <br> 2. Wash or sanitize your hands after removing any mask. <br></p>

     <h1>Taking off your mask while you eat or drink</h1>
 </div>
 <div class="description">
     <p>If you are taking off your mask to eat or drink outside of your home, you can place it somewhere
         safe to keep it clean, such as your pocket, purse, or paper bag. After eating, put the mask back 
         on with the same side facing out. Be sure to wash or sanitize your hands again after taking off 
         your mask and after putting your mask back on.</p>

 <div class="sub-heading">
      <h1>When to throw away or change your mask</h1>
 </div>        
 <div class="description">
     <p>• Disposable masks should be thrown away after they're worn once. <br>
        • If you use respirators, check the manufacturer's instructions to learn how long they can be worn
         before they should be thrown away. <br>
        • Disposable masks and respirators that become wet or dirty should be thrown away in the trash right
         away. Do not continue to wear a wet or dirty mask. Replace it with a dry, clean mask. <br></p>
