          <p >Respiratory viruses like coronavirus disease (COVID-19) spread when mucus or droplets containing the 
            virus get into your body through your eyes, nose or throat. Often, the virus can easily spread from 
            one person to the next via hands. <br>

            <br> During a global pandemic, one of the cheapest, easiest, and most important ways to prevent 
            the spread of a virus is to wash your hands frequently with soap and water. <br>
            
            <br> Here's everything you need to know about how to wash your hands the right way:</p>

           <h1>1. How do I wash my hands properly?</h1>
        </div>
        <div class="description">
           <p>To eliminate all traces of the virus on your hands, a quick scrub and a rinse won't cut it. Below is
             a step-by-step process for effective handwashing. <br>

           <br>• Step 1: Wet hands with running water. <br>
           <br>• Step 2: Apply enough soap to cover wet hands. <br>
           <br>• Step 3: Scrub all surfaces of the hands - including back of hands, between fingers and 
           under nails - for at least 20 seconds. <br>
           <br>• Step 4: Rinse thoroughly with running water. <br>
           <br>• Step 5: Dry hands with a clean cloth or single-use towel. <br></p>

        </div>
        <div class="description">
           <p>You should wash your hands for at least 20-30 seconds. An easy way to time it is by singing 
            the full happy birthday song, twice. <br>

            <br> The same goes for hand sanitizer: use a sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol and
             rub it into your hands for at least 20 seconds to ensure full coverage.</p>

            <h1>3. When should I wash my hands?</h1>
        </div>
        <div class="description">
            <p>In the context of COVID-19 prevention, you should make sure to wash your hands at the following 
                times: <br>

                <br>  • After blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing. <br>
                <br>  • After visiting a public space, including public transportation, markets and places 
                of worship. <br>
                <br>  • After touching surfaces outside of the home, including money. <br>
                <br>  • Before, during and after caring for a sick person. <br>
                <br>  • Before and after eating. <br>
                <br> In general, you should always wash your hands at the following times: <br>
                
                <br>  • After using the toilet. <br>
                <br>  • Before and after eating. <br>
                <br>  • After handling garbage. <br>
                <br>  • After touching animals and pets. <br>
                <br>  • After changing babies' diapers or helping children use the toilet. <br>
                <br>  • When your hands are visibly dirty. </p>

        <div class="sub-heading">
             <h1>4. Do I need to use warm water to wash my hands?</h1>
        </div>        
        <div class="description">
            <p>No, you can use any temperature of water to wash your hands. Cold water and warm water 
                are equally effective at killing germs and viruses - as long as you use soap!</p>
        </div>
        <div class="sub-heading">
             <h1>5. Do I need to dry my hands with a towel?</h1>
        </div>
        <div class="description">
             <p>Germs spread more easily from wet skin than from dry skin, so drying your hands completely 
                is an important step. Paper towels or clean cloths are the most effective way to remove germs
                 without spreading them to other surfaces.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="sub-heading">
             <h1>6. Which is better: washing your hands with soap and water or using hand sanitizer?</h1>
        </div>
        <div class="description">
             <p>In general, both handwashing with soap and water and hand sanitizer, when practiced/used 
                correctly, are highly effective at killing most germs and pathogens. <br>

                <br> Soap kills the coronavirus by destroying the outer shell that protects it. <br>
                
                <br> If your hands look dirty, you should wash them with soap and water. Hand sanitizer is less 
                effective on visibly dirty hands. Hand sanitizer is often more convenient when you are outside
                 of the home, but can be expensive or difficult to find in emergency contexts. Also, alcohol-based 
                 hand sanitizer kills the coronavirus, but it does not kill all kinds of bacteria and viruses,
                  for example, the norovirus and rotavirus which cause diarrhea. It can also be toxic if 
                  swallowed and it should be stored out of reach of children and used only under adult 
                  supervision.</p>

        <div class="sub-heading">
            <h1>7. What if I don't have soap?</h1>
        </div>
        <div class="description">
            <p>In the absence of soap and running water, using hand sanitizer that contains at least 60 per cent 
                alcohol is the best second option. Using soapy water or ash may help remove bacteria, though not 
                as effectively. If these methods are used, it is important to wash your hands as soon as possible 
                when you do have access to handwashing facilities, and avoid contact with people and surfaces in
                 the meantime.</p>

        <div class="sub-heading"><h1>8. How else can I help stop the spread of the coronavirus?</h1></div>
        <div class="description">
            <p> • Practice physical distancing: stay at least one metre (three feet) apart from others, air 
                rooms frequently or leave the windows open, avoiding shaking hands, hugging or kissing people, 
                sharing food, utensils, cups and towels. <br>
                <br> • Wear a mask whenever you are unable to maintain physical distance, especially indoors. <br>
                <br> • Stay home if you feel unwell and avoid close contact with anyone who has cold or flu-like 
                symptoms; seek medical care early if you or your child has a fever, cough or difficulty 
                breathing. <br>
                <br> • Use proper sneezing and coughing etiquette: cover your mouth and nose with a flexed elbow or 
                tissue when coughing or sneezing; dispose of used tissues immediately and wash your hands. <br>
                <br> • Avoid touching your face (mouth, nose, eyes). <br>
                <br> • Clean surfaces that might have come in touch with the virus, and generally clean surfaces more 
                frequently (especially in public spaces).</p>
