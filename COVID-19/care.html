</header>

<section class="section">
   <div class="description">
     <p>The most common symptoms are: <br>

       <br> • Cough <br>
        • Fever or chills <br>
        • Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing <br>
        • Muscle or body aches <br>
        • Sore throat <br>
        • New loss of taste or smell <br>
        • Diarrhea <br>
        • Headache <br>
        • Fatigue <br>
        • Nausea or vomiting <br>
        • Congestion or runny nose <br>

      <br>  Some of these symptoms are very common and can occur due to many conditions other than COVID-19, 
        the disease caused by the coronavirus called SARS CoV-2. If you have any of the symptoms, contact 
        a doctor or other health care provider, who can assess your risk and help you determine the next 
        steps. <br>

      <h1>Emergency Warning Signs of Severe COVID-19 — When to Call 911</h1>
   </div>
   <div class="description">
      <p>If you or someone in your household is experiencing any of the following symptoms, call 911 or your
         local emergency room right away and let the operator know that you are calling for someone who might
          have COVID-19: <br>

        <br>  • Difficulty breathing <br>
          • Persistent pain or pressure in the chest <br>
          • New confusion <br>
          • Inability to wake up or stay awake <br>
          • Bluish lips or face <br>

      <br>  There are other possible symptoms of COVID-19. Call your doctor or health care center regarding any 
        symptoms that are severe or concerning to you. <br></p>
   </div>
   <div class="sub-heading">
      <h1>When should I contact a doctor about my symptoms?</h1>
   </div>
   <div class="description">
      <p>If you feel ill, call your doctor's office or health care center and explain your symptoms 
        over the phone. The next steps will be discussed, including whether you should have a coronavirus
         test. If it turns out that you have COVID-19, mild cases can be managed at home with rest and
          self-isolation. If you become severely ill, you may need hospital care. <br></p>
   </div>
   <div class="sub-heading">
       <h1>If I'm exposed to the coronavirus, how long will it be before I might develop symptoms?</h1>
   </div>
   <div class="description">
       <p>Symptoms can begin two to 14 days after you have been infected with SARS-CoV-2. A study led by
         researchers at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health shows that the median time for 
         symptoms to show up is about five days, however, CDC research suggests that the median time for
          omicron symptoms to develop is about three days.  <br>

      <br>  If you suspect you were exposed to or had close contact with someone with COVID-19, you should
         self-quarantine, watch for symptoms and consider getting tested four or five days following the 
         exposure. Exposure is contact with someone infected with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19,
          in a way that increases the likelihood of becoming infected with the virus. Close contact is being
           less than 6 feet away from an infected person (laboratory-confirmed or a clinical diagnosis) 
           for a cumulative total of 15 minutes or more during a 24-hour period. <br>
        
       <br> Please review CDC guidelines for isolation and quarantine to help prevent the spread of
        COVID-19 <br></p>

   <div class="sub-heading">
        <h1>What are the first symptoms of coronavirus infection?</h1>
   </div>        
   <div class="description">
       <p>Early symptoms reported by some people include fatigue, headache, sore throat and fever. Others
         experience a loss of smell or taste. COVID-19 can cause symptoms that are mild at first, but then 
         become more intense over five to seven days, with worsening cough and shortness of breath. Some
          people who have COVID-19 develop pneumonia. <br>

      <br>   The type and severity of first symptoms can vary widely from person to person. This is why it is 
        very important to call your doctor if you have symptoms, even mild ones. <br></p>
   </div>
   <div class="sub-heading">
        <h1>Can you have the coronavirus without a fever?</h1>
   </div>
   <div class="description">
        <p>Yes. A fever is one of the common symptoms of COVID-19, but you can be infected with the 
            coronavirus and have a cough or other symptoms with no fever, or a very low-grade one — especially 
            in the first few days. Keep in mind that it is also possible to have the coronavirus with
             minimal symptoms or even no symptoms at all. People infected with the coronavirus who 
             have no symptoms can still spread the virus to others. <br></p>
   </div>
   <div class="sub-heading">
        <h1>Can you have the coronavirus without a cough?</h1>
   </div>
   <div class="description">
        <p>Yes. A cough is one of the common symptoms of COVID-19, but it is not always present. You
             can be infected with the coronavirus and not have a cough. If you do have one, it may be 
             mild and infrequent, or you may cough heavily at times. Remember that it is possible to have
              COVID-19 with minimal symptoms or even no symptoms at all. People infected with the coronavirus
               who have no symptoms can still spread the virus to others. <br></p>
   </div>
   <div class="sub-heading">
       <h1>Can COVID-19 symptoms come and go?</h1>
   </div>
   <div class="description">
       <p>Yes. During the recovery process, people with COVID-19 might experience recurring symptoms 
        alternating with periods of feeling better. Varying degrees of fever, fatigue and breathing 
        problems can occur, on and off, for days or even weeks. <br></p>
   </div>
   <div class="sub-heading"><h1>Can you have COVID-19 without symptoms?</h1></div>
   <div class="description">
       <p>Yes. Symptoms of COVID-19 usually show up two to 14 days after exposure to SARS-CoV-2, but some
         people who are infected do not develop symptoms or feel ill. When this happens, a person is
          called asymptomatic. This is why it is so important to wear a face mask and to practice physical
           distancing and hand hygiene. People can be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19 and 
           not realize it, but still be able to transmit the virus to other people. <br></p>
   </div>
   <div class="sub-heading">
    <h1>What are COVID-19 symptoms in children?</h1>
 </div>
 <div class="description">
    <p>Like adults, babies and children with COVID-19 can have symptoms including fever, cough, sore throat, 
        difficulty breathing and diarrhea. Cases have been increasing among children, as indicated by recent
         data from the American Academy of Pediatrics.  <br>

       <br> Children may also be at risk for multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) — an uncommon
         but serious complication of the coronavirus. Parents and guardians should be on guard for signs of
          MIS-C and call their child's doctor immediately if they appear <br>.</p>
 </div>
 <div class="sub-heading">
    <h1>How are coronavirus symptoms different from <br> allergy symptoms? What about flu, colds
         and <br> strep throat?</h1>
 </div>
 <div class="description">
    <p>COVID-19 shares symptoms with other conditions such as allergies, the flu and strep throat. It may
         be very hard to tell the difference between COVID-19 and flu without a test. <br>

       <br> If you have symptoms that might be due to the coronavirus, contact a health care provider, describe
         your symptoms and follow the provider's recommendations. <br></p>
 </div>
 <div class="sub-heading">
     <h1>If I receive the coronavirus vaccine, will I get COVID-19 symptoms?</h1>
 </div>
 <div class="description">
     <p>No. The COVID-19 vaccines authorized by the Food and Drug Administration cannot and will not give 
        you COVID-19. These coronavirus vaccines can cause side effects because they activate your immune
         system, but this does not mean you are infected with the coronavirus or that you have COVID-19. 
         As your immune system responds to the vaccine and learns to recognize and fight the coronavirus,
          fever, pain at the injection site and muscle aches are possible, but these are usually both mild
           and temporary. Learn more about the safety of the coronavirus vaccines. <br></p>
